Introduction to Selenium Grid
Selenium Grid is a powerful tool that allows you to run multiple Selenium tests in parallel across different browsers, operating systems, and machines. It consists of a hub and multiple nodes. The hub controls the execution of tests on different nodes.
Step 1: Setting Up Selenium Grid Hub on EC2
    • Log in to your AWS account.
    • Launch a new EC2 instance (Choose an OS based on your preference ubuntu).
    • Install Java on the EC2 instance.
    • Download and start the Selenium Grid Hub:
sudo apt update

sudo apt install default-jre

#download standalone selenium

wget https://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/3.141/selenium-server-standalone-3.141.59.jar

# Start the Selenium Grid Hub on your EC2 instance.

java -jar selenium-server-standalone-3.141.59.jar -role hub

    • 
Access the hub using http://<EC2-Public-IP>:4444/grid/console.
Setting up Hub and Nodes on EC2
Step 2: Registering Nodes with Different Browsers
    • Launch multiple EC2 instances (nodes) with different configurations (e.g., different browsers and operating systems).
    • Install Java on each node.
    • Download and start the Selenium Standalone Server on each node as shown above
    • Type following command to register the nodes
    • 
http://<Hub-IP>:4444/grid/register
    • 
    • Nodes will be registered with the hub.

Step 3: Running a Test Suite in Parallel
You can use EC2 or Local Machine. It's totally up to you to run the test suite in parallel.

from selenium import webdriver
import time

# Define the capabilities (browser, platform)
capabilities = {
    "browserName": "chrome",
    "platform": "LINUX"
}

options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()
options.set_capability("browserName", "chrome")
options.set_capability("platform", "LINUX")

# Start the browsers, make sure to replace your Public IPs
driver1 = webdriver.Remote(
    command_executor='http://172.31.19.249:4444/wd/hub',
    options=options
)

driver2 = webdriver.Remote(
    command_executor='http://172.31.19.249:4444/wd/hub',
    options=options
)

# Close the browsers
time.sleep(5)
driver1.quit()
driver2.quit()

Explanation:
    • We import necessary libraries and define desired capabilities for different browsers.
    • We start the browsers using webdriver.Remote by specifying the node's URL.
    • We perform tests on the browsers as usual.
    • Finally, we close the browsers.

Conclusion:
By following these steps, you have successfully set up a Selenium Grid on AWS and executed tests in parallel across different nodes with different browsers. This lab demonstrates the power of parallel test execution for efficient and faster testing.
