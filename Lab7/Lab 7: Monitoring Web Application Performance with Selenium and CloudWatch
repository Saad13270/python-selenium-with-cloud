Basics of Web Performance Monitoring
Web performance monitoring involves measuring and analyzing various metrics related to the speed and responsiveness of a website. Key metrics include page load times, resource loading times, and user interaction responsiveness.

Introduction to AWS CloudWatch
Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring service for AWS resources and the applications you run on the cloud platform. It provides data and actionable insights to monitor your applications, understand and respond to system-wide performance changes, optimize resource utilization, and get a unified view of operational health.

Step 1: Setting Up AWS CloudWatch
    • Log in to your AWS account.
    • Go to the CloudWatch dashboard.
    • Create a new custom metric.

Step 2: Create AWS Access Keys
Open IAM
Select Your User
Goto Security Credentials tab
Scroll down and click create access keys
Select the Application option
Click create
Download the csv file and keep it safe


Step 3: Developing Selenium Scripts for Performance Monitoring in PyCharm and Integrating Selenium with CloudWatch

from selenium import webdriver
import time
import boto3

# Initialize the WebDriver (e.g., Chrome)
driver = webdriver.Chrome()

# Open the webpage you want to monitor
driver.get("https://example.com")

# Measure page load time
start_time = time.time()
driver.get("https://example.com")
end_time = time.time()
load_time = end_time - start_time

# Initialize the CloudWatch client
cloudwatch = boto3.client('cloudwatch',
                         aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID',
                         aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY',
                         region_name='YOUR_REGION')

# Push the metric to CloudWatch
cloudwatch.put_metric_data(
    Namespace='WebPerformance',
    MetricData=[
        {
            'MetricName': 'PageLoadTime',
            'Value': load_time,
            'Unit': 'Seconds',
            'Dimensions': [
                {
                    'Name': 'WebPage',
                    'Value': 'example.com'
                },
            ]
        },
    ]
)

# Close the browser
driver.quit()

Explanation:
    • We use Selenium to open a webpage and measure the time it takes to load.
    • We use the time module to record the start and end times.
    • We use the boto3 library to interact with AWS services.
    • We push the measured load time as a custom metric to CloudWatch.

Conclusion:
By following these steps, you have successfully set up web performance monitoring using Selenium and pushed the metrics to AWS CloudWatch. This lab demonstrates how to integrate web application performance monitoring into your AWS environment for real-time insights.
